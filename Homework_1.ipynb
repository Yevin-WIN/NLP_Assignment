    ": 1. In distributional semantics, a word's meaning can vary depending on its placement within a sentence. Thus, its meaning is determined by contextual factors rather than independent words. The distributional hypothesis is grounded in this theory, states that words with similar meanings are likely to be used in similar contexts.\n",
    ": 2. The distributional hypothesis is important for NLP systems in facilitating to understand word relationships. For example, by analysing the neighbouring words (context) of a certain word, a distributional representation of the word can be formed as a vector. This process provides computers with an advantage for computation and representation."

My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched.

Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.\n"
