When repetitive and simple tasks are outsourced through crowdsourcing, companies are able to invest their time and resources in more complex tasks. In addition, the flexibility to increase or decrease the number of people available to meet the company's needs is also the specific feature of crowdsourcing. As a result, leveraging the skills of distributed workers is a more cost-effective way of doing things compared to using a dedicated expert."
